                "description": "The hanging crunch an abdominal exercise that targets the rectus abdominis or \"six-pack\" muscles. It can be performed hanging from a bar, on a dip station or parallel bars, or if grip strength is a limitation, by placing the elbows in ab straps. If hanging from a straight bar is uncomfortable to the wrists or shoulders, you can also perform them hanging with a neutral grip (palms facing one another). It is similar to a hanging knee raise, but with more spinal curling and a more pronounced \"crunch\" at the top.",

The hip and torso motion are similar to a kettlebell swing, as are the muscles it targets, including the hamstrings, glutes, upper back, and grip. However, unlike the traditional kettlebell swing, the arms are outside of the knees. This movement can be performed for time or for reps, but is usually performed for relatively high reps, such as 8-12 sets per rep or more, as part of a fat-loss or athleticism-focused circuit or workout.",

Holding dumbbells in the racked position further challenges the core and upper-back muscles to maintain posture while the lower body moves. Lunge variations are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps per leg or more, as part of the lower-body portion of a workout. If this movement hurts your knees, try performing split squats instead.",

It is popular in high-rep \"pump\"-style arm workouts. The bands should be placed as high as possible on your arms, at a tightness of no greater than 8 on a scale of 10. Most BFR workouts recommend using a far lighter weight than usual, perhaps as low as 25-50 percent of a normal working weight.",

It targets the legs, glutes, biceps, shoulders, and triceps in a single sequence, making it a great way to burn serious calories and hit a lot of muscles in a short period of time. The upper-body movements will determine the amount of weight you can effectively use.",

There are many ways to perform this movement (strict or swinging, arms completely straight or slightly bent, legs straight or bent) each providing unique benefits and challenges. Initially, it may be a difficult move to do for a single rep, but once you build the requisite core, lat, and shoulder strength, it can be performed for higher reps.",

Leg raises are often performed for moderate to high reps, such as 8-12 reps or more, as part of ab-focused training. However, this difficult variation may require some time to build up to those rep ranges.",

                    "description": "The straight-arm dumbbell pull-over is an exercise that targets the muscles of the pecs, lats, and serratus anterior muscles. Performing this movement with straight arms makes it more difficult, increases the stretch on the serratus muscles and lats, and forces the core to work harder. Old-school bodybuilders would perform pull-overs with light weights for sets of 20 between sets of heavy 20-rep squats, but they are more popular today in moderate rep ranges, such as 8-12 reps per set, as part of an upper-body workout.",
